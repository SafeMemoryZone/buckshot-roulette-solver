# Buckshot Roulette Solver

Expectimax solver for the game Buckshot-Roulette. This algorithm is designed to work exclusively for normal mode (it does not support "double or nothing" mode).

## Note

The solver only implements a trivial evaluation function and there are several improvements to be made. Contributions are welcome!
